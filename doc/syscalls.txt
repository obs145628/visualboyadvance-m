Implementation:

Syscalls are inplemented by wirtting bytes on VRAM.

Syscall Trigger: 0x06000250
Syscall argument: 0x06000251 and after
When writing a word at memory address of syscall trigger (any word), a syscall is trigger
Syscall arguments contains in order: syscall number, args 0 to args 3. All arguments are uint32_t
Return value of syscall stored in arg0


This is done by tweaking CPUWriteMemory (in src/gba/GBAinline.h).
If address equals syscall trigger, my own function is called that read the memory to get the syscall number and the arguments, and it executes it.
I use CPUReadMemoryQuick (in the same file) to read the data (syscall args, and others). It seem to work no matter if it's vram, or other sections.

I also create my own source files: syscall.h / syscall.cpp in ./src/gba.
This is done by editing the root CMakeLists.txt: add the source files to SRC_GBA




Available syscalls:

1: sys_exit(u32 ret_code): void

exit the program with return code ret_code

3: sys_read(in_fd, out_buf, count): count

Try to read count bytes from file descriptor in_fd, and store it to out_buf.
Returns the number of bytes read.
In case of error, returns ((u32) -1)

4: sys_write(out_fd, in_buf, count): count

Try to write count bytes to file descriptor out_fd, loaded from in_buf.
Returns the number of bytes written.
In case of error, returns ((u32) -1)

5: sys_open(path, flags, mode): fd

Try to open the file located by path, with the specific flags and mode.
Returns the fd of the opened file
In case of error, returns ((u32) -1)

6: sys_close(fd): status

Close the corresponding file descriptor.
Returns 0 on success
In case of error, returns ((u32) -1)






Testing:

Simply run emulator with the GBA file:
./visualboyadvance-m /home/obs/lun/tonc-tuto/syscalls-exs/touuper/toupper.gba



Configuration:

Can be configured with env variables

VBAM_SYSCALL_STDIN=<path>
By default, stdin is the standard stdin (fd 0)
Can be changed to any file. if "-", it's stdin

VBAM_SYSCALL_STDOUT=<path>
By default, stdout is the standard stdouut (fd 1)
Can be changed to any file. if "-", it's stdout

VBAM_SYSCALL_STDERR=<path>
By default, stderr is the standard stderr (fd 2)
Can be changed to any file. if "-", it's stderr
